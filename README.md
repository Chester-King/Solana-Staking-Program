## Solana Staking and APY

The program has three major features

### Locking of tokens 

Any user can come and lock a specific SPL token. The timestamp of the token lock is stored in the minter account

### Unlocking of the tokens

Once a user who has locked their tokens can unlock them as well

### Claiming rewards 

Depending on how many tokens and for how long the tokens are locks. The user can claim the rewards which are at the rate of 10% APY. Once the user do so, the lock timestamp resets in the minter account.
